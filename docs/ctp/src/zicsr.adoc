=== Zicsr

Zicsr privileged tests access to CSRs that are mandatory in each privilege mode.
It also tests mandatory privileged instructions: `ecall`, `ebreak`, `mret`, and `sret`.
The CSR read/write/set/clear instructions themselves are tested in the
unprivileged Zicsr tests of <<Zicsr Control/Status Register Instructions>>.

`wfi` is tested in <<Interrupts>> and `sfence.vma` is tested in <<Sv* Virtual Memory>>.

Zicsr does not test reserved or custom instructions or CSRs because their behavior is Unspecified.
Reserved instructions and CSRs are tested in the <<Ssstrict>> Ssstrict tests,
where they should throw an Illegal Instruction exception if not implemented.
