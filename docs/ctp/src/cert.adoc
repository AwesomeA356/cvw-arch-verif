== Certification Process

Certifying a RISC-V Device-Under-Test (DUT) involves the following steps:

* Selecting a profile for the DUT
* Providing a Unified Database (UDB) configuration for the DUT, such as optional extensions, peripheral addresses, and PMP granularity
* Generating self-checking tests based on the selected profile and UDB
* Running the tests and reporting pass/fail

Test developers also need to
* Generate a coverage report confirming that the tests hit all the coverpoints footnote:[Open question whether to generate coverage from a Sail log or the DUT.  DUT requires a suitable testbench with RVVI interface, but is more robust to check that the tests fully run.]
